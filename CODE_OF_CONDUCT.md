# Gufo Stack Code of Conduct

Gufo Stack are the tools built by people for people. We aim to create a respectful, collaborative,
and constructive community where everyone can contribute to building better software.

## The Rule

> *“And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.”*
> 
> -- Luke 6:31

## The Note

This principle is universal. Similar wisdom can be found in many traditions:

- Confucius: *“Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself.”* (Analects 15:24)
- Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): *“None of you [truly] believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”* (Hadith, Sahih Muslim 45:71)

That’s all.
