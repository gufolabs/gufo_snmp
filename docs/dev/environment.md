# Developer's Environment

To participate in development you need to prepare the developer's
environment first. Depending on the preferable tools, your mileage may vary.

## Visual Studio Code Dev Container

The easiest way to start the development is to use [Visual Studio Code][VSCode]
with [Remote Containers][Remote Containers] plugin. Just click on the green sign
in the lower-left corner and select the "Reopen in Container" menu item. You'll get
all the required formatting and linting settings out of the box.
