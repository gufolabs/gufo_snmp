# Code Quality Guide

We share the common code quality standards between all Gufo Labs projects.

## Python Code Formatting

All Python code must be formatting using [Ruff][Ruff] code formatter
with settings defined in the project's `pyproject.toml` file.

## Python Code Linting

All Python code must pass [ruff][ruff] tests with the project's settings.

## Python Code Static Checks

All python code must pass [Mypy][Mypy] type checks in the `strict` mode.

## Test Suite Coverage

The test suite must provide 100% code coverage whenever possible.

## Documentation Standards

* Documentation must be clean and mean.
